    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://hello.processing.org">the hour of code for processing</a> by daniel shiffman - i tell everyone to do this that expresses even a passing interest in learning how to program. i talk more abt dan further down but he works so sososososo hard on making things that could be complicated accessible to many ppl w/ many diff backgrounds so if u can set aside maybe 45 minutes i recommend u do this ok !! you may want to also check out his book <a href="http://learningprocessing.com">learning processing</a> for further info (i can maybe help u find an ebook if u just email me or tweet at me or s/t)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.auntiepixelante.com/twine/">how to make games with twine</a> by auntie pixelante / anna anthropy - twine is a platform for making interactive fiction games for ppl w/ no programming experience !! it's all visual so u dont have to write a lick of code if u dont want to !! a lot of great stuff has been made w/ twine u should just google it tbh
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.flickgame.org/">flick</a> - this is a lil more esoteric initially than the other things but the core concepts are actually super simple and u can make a goofy game in no time. click the help button and mess with the buttons until you get a feel for it. try out any of the games at the <a href="http://flickgamegallery.tumblr.com/">flick game gallery</a> if you feel confused about the format.

    <h1>
      "TECHNICAL" BOOKS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY GOOD AT RELAYING INFORMATION
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://natureofcode.com/">the nature of code</a> (pay what u want ebook) by <a href="http://twitter.com/shiffman">daniel shiffman</a> - this is not an intro programming text (if u want something for beginners you should check out <a href="http://learningprocessing.com/">learning processing</a> as i mentioned above (as always email or tweet at me or s/t if u cant find an ebook dl somewhere) by the same person) but it's mayb one of the most best goodest Creative Coding texts for intermediate programmers of All Time....daniel shiffman takes such great care in his Pedagogy, the way he develops n explains systems n models is so thoughtful i love it ok.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html">programming in lua</a> (html textbook) by <a href="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/">roberto ierusalimschy</a> (co-creator of lua) - do u want to know something shocking? this is the only programming resource i've ever encountered which defaults to she/her pronouns w/r/t the Hypothetical Programmer. this is not a beginner's programming book but it's a very careful, thoughtful, accessible survey of the only programming language i truly love, lua. i really love it...i actually have read this twice cover to cover. lua is porteguese for moon n it is worthy of the title imo
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Node-js-Basarat-Syed/dp/1484201884">beginning node.js</a> (amazon link) by <a href="https://twitter.com/basarat">basarat syed</a> - i only just started reading this but i actually understood closures for the first time in the 1.5 yrs since they were initially explained to me after reading the chapters on the basics of javascript. rly good so far imo !! email me if u have trouble finding an ebook.......just email me.........
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/v0.11/book.pdf">theory and technique of electronic music</a> (pdf link) by <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/">miller puckette</a> - this is easily the densest of the texts listed here which is why it's at the end. miller puckette created both max and pure data (pd) which are two of the world's most well known audio programming platforms !!!! this book is rly math heavy and i've barely made a dent in it but it rly digs into the atomic aspects of digital sound which rarely get talked abt and i bet if more ppl read it music would increase in quality by approximately 10-15%
