i’ve spent the last couple of days talking about attention economies and reckless entitlement of the contemporary avant garde and i already know it and understand it and really only care insofar as it makes it easier to do my work (this is the only thing theory is good for for me, i hate theory on its own unless it helps me do something, like it’s scaffolding for the end product, i hate holding scaffolding for examination independently) BUT the idea is the democratization of art has been GOOD for allowing the (micro)canonization of voices which were otherwise violently silenced and omitted by prev art institutions….except only barely. marginally. only marginally do these voices have audiences compared to what they had before. the BAD stuff that came w/ the democratization of art is that we have 10,000 unthoughtful matchbox twenty rip offs and 10,000 unthoughtful merzbow rip offs and only maybe 30 bands we actually care about at any given moment, tops, but each of these entities is competing for our attention with the same vigor simultaneously so the recipient of an art vehicle is constantly encumbered by a decision making process whose required energy far exceeds their capacity often, so we end up relying on institutions anyway except, EXCEPT ! these institutions are now driven by popular taste and in order to maintain interest in populist democratized art institutions u have to be immediately palatable unlesS u have an Old Art World institution vouching for u b/c ppl aren’t willing to take risks on art that is challenging if they don’t know whether the payoff will be worth it (Specifically because these avant gardists and matchbox twentyists are being so reeckless with the attention they seek from recipients because they feel entitled as noisemakers)….so so so many noisemakers are unconscientious re: their output, rarely consider how they’re using a recipients time, and so. and so the general populace (GP) become jaded, and rightfully so, but further perpetuating this schism, right, where we hav art institutions which guide our taste and vouch for difficult stuff just like before with our academic canons except we also have a populist canon existing contemporaneously, parallel, which feeds the other, but which jades recipients further, the institutions which vouch begin accommodating these shifting expectations, etc etc, feeding and feeding the same thing…..i just wish more artists would think “is this essential? does this work love the recipient? does this feel vital to me to share? does this do more good than harm? am i giving people what i think they need rather than what i think they want? am i using the recipient’s time wisely? do i have something i truly feel needs to be said?” rn most artists (esp artists our age, artists who post on tumblr and instagram and twitter etc), because they are trapped in a chronologically ordered attn economy, are not asking these questionss because there is no time to….seemingly…..how long do ppl spend looking at a tumblr image before they reblog? how many times do people revisit the things they reblog? the attention economy of artists using digital means of conveyance looks like human beings frantically turning over rocks and looking in trash cans for bread crumbs to throw at a pond…….honestly fuck most art and fuck most artists because they don’t love me !! and don’t care about how they use my time !! i’m not going to sit around and piddle with “well, taste is taste, we’re all entitled to our opinions, etc” i think…..i think its ok to tell ppl to sit down if u feel ur time was wasted if u have been thoughtful abt the ways in which it has done so. sharing economies have fucked art too….i hate feeds, i hate streams, i hate curating profiles. that’s why i made my site. *an echo from a mountain somewhere, a person screaming* MICROBLOGS WHICH ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON SHARING AND COLLECTING ECHO THE SORT OF COMMODITY FETISHISM LATE CAPITALISM IS KNOWN FOR, EVERY TWITTER USER IS A LIBERTARIAN ANARCHO CAPITALIST SICK FUCK….im like….i will be a fascist and i will hurt people’s feelings and i don’t care at all. at all. at all. this is bigger than feelings!!!……a common retort to these pts is that the author is already dead which is a disgusting misreading of roland barthes and honestly lazy and young academics are some of the least thoughtful ppl i have ever met. we can say the author is dead and it be true ONLY INSOFAR AS our reading of a text is concerned, yes, this is true and accurate, human beings are imperfect lenses, introducing human intent into something so muddy as INTERPRETATION of something which has become EXTRINSIC from a human being is disturbing and wasteful of time! but! it is also true that people make art for terrible fucking reasons. lol. like we can say intent exists and we can examine its impact in a way that is entirely discrete from our interpretation of a text which is what that barthes essay is about, the author falls off of a text like a bee falls off of its impaled stinger. barthes meant that the author is irrelevant to interpretation of a text and that’s all! that’s it! overreading this is such a sin in my opinion! and so then we can talk about sampling and reproduction and appropriation and how that has devalued the author in the last 100 yrs. and yes like i would agree that the author strictly as a cultural concept (as a proprietor and owner) is waning but authors still exist, appropriation can be violent, people need to be careful and conscientious! human volition in art will exist in all contexts as something that can be sussed out and examined and critiqued as far as cultural impact goes. irreverance can be violence against the wrong ppl/institutions/etc….like…trolls……when i look through newhive or listen to saint pepsi or pc music i know that artists love reusing cultural data b/c it’s immediately evocative, it is familiar syntax for the recipient of a work, so it’s sort of like having a mutual friend with the reader, which is manipulative to beginw ith but so is art in general. the thing is however if u have a negligent or malignant artist wielding and prodding your mutual friend recklessly that is shitty! so a lot of these vaporwave artists and “”“"net artists”“”“ are using cultural data which has emotional weight, serious emotional weight for the recipient, in a way that is shitty, like "haha look at this!!! this is making u feel somethings about your past and i’m chopping it all up into some funhouse mirror critique of NOTHING haha u dumb baby”…..but there’s a reason chuck person and oneohtrix pt never in general do something different to the reader than st pepsi. it’s because daniel lopatin is careful with how he uses cultural data, he uses it to transfigure and examine rather than manipulate and shock via maximalist collage or oblique parody…..also, on contemporary usage of the term net artist since ~2012: taping an inkjet print to a canvas doesnt make u a painter, mailing a painting doesnt make you a “postal service artist,” using the internet as yr means of conveyance, even if ur work is in dialogue w/ net culture, isnt enough to make u a net artist, im so annoyed, the internet is a tool and a medium but net artists in the last 3 yrs seem to think that as long as u post a photoshop collage on yr tumblr u are a net artist and i am so irritated abt it. if we can say that an author, regardless of her presence/absence in a text, definitely exists somewhere, we can also probably say conscious artistic volition can exist parallel to or as a sort of guiding force to pen movement, i think, regardless of if the end result reveals this fact or not. and it cannot to us directly, which i agree w/ barthes on, there is a deep chasm btwn text and author which is unbridgeable but i think we can examine either side separately as a mechanical process, as a circulating system. and we can do this armed with multiple readings of texts too i think. regarding movements, between texts we can see a homogeny of voices (see the part of death of the author which insists the author is merely an assembly of cultural data repurposed, like a garbage monster or s/t lol), there are predominating technical trends and narrative trends which span texts written in a given movement and time period….this sort of interest in historical context is very structuralist of me but hold on….we dont NEED time or history to know this, we can do this armed with texts only by examining them mechanically. also at this pt im not like all abt barthes even though his work in literary theory is the only i’ve truly internalized i think b/c again i think academia is useless unless it helps me do my fucking work. i think barthes is very important from strictly a literary theory pt of view and is core to how i read texts but i think that a destruction of authority like this and giving that over to readers is effectively democratizing interpretation…then we hav the vox populi determining meaning….if enough ppl say that a text means x then theres no one to intervene….everyone is entitled to “their own opinion”….but what if nobody is seeing something important in a text except ten people? what if the predominating reading of a text is dangerous, shortsighted? and it is increasingly that, dangerously shortsighted, specifically because the contemporary attention economies discourages organizing by concept and instead encourages organizing data by chronology, “current.” currency. wow. currency. current. wow. so i think this is just one lens, an important lens. what i mean is we can fairly easily talk about how an art culture or movement and its economies of authorship/consumption armed with its texts but not so easily talk about texts armed with information abt its culture/movement and its economies of authorship/consumption. the circuit goes one way…..THE THING IS, this is important, the thing is as a recipient of a work we do emotional labor for the text. we open ourselves to it, make ourselves vulnerable to it, allow it intimate access to us, allow it to take our time away from work and family and friends and other works of art and literally everything, everything, all of it, we give ourselves to it. if a work isn’t going to be grateful for that opportunity and give me something that i need, or it thinks i need, and love me, then it is a waste of my time and i wish it didnt exist. and i can wish that people stopped making art because fuck you that’s why. when you have unprecedented access to tools and methods and platforms but have no institutions to guide or educate (b/c all of the institutions under a free market (i.e. democratized, populist, etc) art economy conform to popular contemporary modes rather than critical examinations which challenge, right) u end up with a lot of people who feel entitled and empowered to make art but very very few people who think abt the consequences (see the parallel in late capitalism here as well?)…..this is why i’m upset….does that all make sense?
