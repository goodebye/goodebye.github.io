  <h1>ONGOING NOTES ON ELECTRONIC MUSIC</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <p>
      been ‘studying’ a few maybe ‘off the beaten path’ or ‘hard to categorize’ electronic musicians from the last ~50 yrs a bit more lately n i want to put some thoughts i have somewhere so i can reference them later, and also to make me seem smart and thoughtful online</p><ul><li>women invented ambient music!!! they did!!!! and i am in dISBELIEF that ppl refer to brian eno (and robert fripp) as if he is thhe Grandfather of ambient music when daphne oram invented ~75% of the ‘ambient vocabulary’ n techniques in the 50′s/60′s. then there were ppl like laurie spiegel, laurie anderson, n pauline oliveros in the 70s (not to mention johanna beyer in the 30s) who all made music 5x as interesting as fripp and eno but for some reason their pioneering work in electronic music has been almost entirely expunged from the electronic music ‘canon.’ daphne oram is not mentioned anywhere on the ‘electronic music’ wikipedia page, and only one woman is mentioned on the ‘ambient music’ page. i am tempted to edit the pages myself b/c this erasure seems p egregious<br></li><li>laurie anderson is conceptually exciting n very funny n maybe one of my favorite composers</li><li>i rly love bjork but every song is starting to sound the same to me b/c her voice is almost Too expressive n the dynamics bleed from track 2 track in my memory</li><li>feel like st vincent (at least on her latest record) has 'borrowed’ some from grace jones which makes me feel irritated b/c ppl have all but forgotten abt grace jones but her influence is Massive tho Unattributed</li><li>one of the difficulties of composing something metered using primarily electronic sounds is trying to produce ‘non-linear expressiveness.’ laurie spiegel feels expressive to me but the ‘unfolding’ of her pieces is more like a filter on a synth slowly opening up to reveal more of the sound as the piece progresses, n that’s pretty much the limit of it (though in this context i think it works really well). daphne oram’s pieces also feel dynamic n expressive but the pieces generally feel like ‘collages’ or like ‘musique concrete’ and don’t generally obey a meter. bjork smartly uses electronic sounds as plucky accents and for percussion while leaving a real string section to do the Swells and Ebbs in the background with these very gentle attacks and Strong, Hard finishes, and her voice parallels this motion. the problem is 99% of contemporary electronic instruments are subject to the same design limitations as instruments designed 30 years ago: yr main means of ‘dynamics’/’expression’ are velocity (how hard u strike a note), and then an ‘envelope’ that determines the attack (how long it takes to build from silence to the max volume of the note (imagine bowing a cello slowly n softly, then increasing in speed and hardness - that time btwn those two volumes is called the ‘attack’ of the envelope)), and the release (how long it takes after you strike a note for it to return from max volume to silence, which doesn’t have an exact acoustic analogue i don’t think). it is very difficult to modulate that attack and release on the fly in a way that feels intuitive and expressive. so you’ll find that most electronic music that is metered follows very regimented progression. like it’ll start off with a kick snare, then a synth line comes in, then another synth line, then the hi hat, etc... there is very rarely any tearjerking, watershed catharsis from the swelling of an electronic instrument b/c of these technological design limitations</li><li>so, i have been thinking abt new approaches to electronic instrumentation b/c i’ve been trying to figure out how my music could be performed in a solo context in a way that is compelling. i feel bored watching videos of oneohtrix point never and panda bear and baths standing (sometimes even sitting!) behind an sp404 or modular synth or akai mpd or whatever. but then i watch videos of st. vincent performing and feel easily Taken by it and i rly want there to be an electronic instrument designed for ‘motion’ as well as expressiveness</li><li>i’ve been turning over in my head a view different solutions to these problems, which i’ll detail here</li><ul><li>so w/r/t expressiveness, i’ve thought about a couple of things. if you haven’t played around with the garageband app for ios, u should try it!!! it takes some interesting approaches to virtual instrument design. i was toying with the orchestra/string section instrument and their approach is rly unique n compelling 2 me</li></ul></ul><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN4rmnHuFFf0"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4rmnHuFFf0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><ul><ul><li>the video explains how this works but in brief: you have 8 little popsicle sticks that represent distinct chords in a given key. to simply perform an orchestral pizzicato of that chord, you tap somewhere on the popsicle stick. to perform an orchestral bowing of that chord, tap and drag. the faster/more intensely you drag your finger up and down on the popsicle stick, the louder the volume. so the attack and release are entirely in your control in a way that feels intuitive!! you can v easily create nonlinear, natural sounding swells. would really love to know who designed this approach.</li><li>this concept could easily be extended to no longer be locked to one key by using a midi keyboard and laptop-y touchpad, one hand on each. i am going to prototype this with like an axiom 25 keyboard and laptop touchpad and arduino sometime in the next couple of months to get a feel for it. i’m also thinking the touchpad could have multiple modes. like, one would simulate a ‘guitar’ type strum by ‘subdividing’ (in software, not physically) the touchpad into sections which correspond with the number of notes pressed on the keyboard, and to play a chord you would just ‘strum’ through the touchpad, whereas to play individual notes you would tap either higher or lower on the touchpad to play the higher or lower notes you have pressed on the keyboard. almost like an omnichord, really.</li><li>w/r/t ‘motion,’ like not having to be tethered to sitting behind a desk or table while on stage, there are a couple of problems with some possible solutions</li><li>most electronic instruments you put, like, on your body which are being sold today 1) use an illogical/impractical note arrangement (e.g. the keytar, whose note layout doesn’t make a lot of sense for Shredding and makes the instrument cumbersome and limited to at most 2 octaves at a time, or the midi guitar, and Don’t Get Me Started on how poorly designed the guitar is); 2) require you to use your mouth to play it (e.g. the eigenharp and other Blow-y type instruments, which means u cannot sing and play simultaneously which is a Big Bummer b/c otherwise these instruments can be pretty cool n are often creative w/ note layouts); and 3) look tacky as all hell!!!!!! (p much all of them)</li><li>starting w/ note layout, i don’t like the design of the guitar for composition at all, and while the design of the piano isn’t nearly as broken for understanding music theory, i still think it’s, like, half broken n not very good. so i’ve been researching alternate note layouts and in the last 150 years ppl have been developing ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard">isomorphic keyboards</a>,’ which is just a catch-all term for keyboards whose layouts are such that when you play a chord in one key, transposing to another key is as simple as moving your hand to the new position and playing the exact same shape. on a piano, for example, a C major chord and a C# major chord require entirely different fingerings even though the tonal relationships are identical, meaning you have to unintuitively learn fingerings for the same tonal relationships in 11 different contexts FOR NO GOOD REASON other than someone sometime decided black keys should be tinier and higher up and all weird etc.</li><li>researching now, some accordions have been made using chromatic isomorphic keys (tho i’m not sure how prevalent - idk much abt accordions). but my main interest is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki-Hayden_note_layout">wicki-hayden keyboard</a>. below is a diagram of that layout.</li></ul></ul><figure data-orig-width="590" data-orig-height="385" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://36.media.tumblr.com/e2b03c48954b50c575739f6c74cf972a/tumblr_inline_nvszfmqtZe1t35e4g_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="590" data-orig-height="385"></figure><ul><ul><li>u can actually find some ios versions of keyboards like this to toy around with. there are videos of ppl playing w/ ‘jammer keyboards’ (colloquial term for instruments w/ an isomorphic note layout) online too which you should look up! but the idea is, unlike the piano, regardless of what key you are playing in, the fingering for a major or a minor or whatever scale is identical, just your hands are physically moved to another location. for example, in case you are not musically inclined, a C major chord is composed of a C, G and an E. find those on the diagram above. now a D major chord is D, F#, A. note that these are entirely the same shape!! and this applies everywhere!! that fingering is universal!! very cool</li><li>so ultimately i have been imagining an instrument w/ a guitarish form factor but with an abbreviated wicki-hayden keyboard for the neck (b/c as it stands now it is Very Vertical but it could be extended horizontally up the neck as well, allowing for more octaves !!!) and with a touchpad on the body for expressive flourishes and plucks, something i can move around on stage and Shred On expressively in a way that feels electric n exciting the way watching someone like st vincent shred feels. but right now i am Too Poor to prototype something like this. sometime soon, maybe!!</li></ul><li>another weird shortcoming of electronic instruments i have no compelling solutions for yet is a failure for play to be ‘physically dialogical’ b/c there’s a lack of acoustic feedback from the device. when i play the guitar or the piano or the cello or whatever, i receive acoustic feedback which informs how i play the instrument In Real Time, like i can FEel with my body when i strike a note weird, which allows me to make snap adjustments from ‘bodily intuition’ (probably more like bodily understanding of consonant/dissonant vibrations) and correct the pitch or timbre etc., like engage in a dialogue with the instrument, and electronic instruments today have no such capacity. one of the reasons for this is the output sound of a digital instrument can vary greatly. the only potential solution i’ve thought of is sort of pulled from the design of wii remote. the speaker on the wii remote in wii sports, e.g., plays the sound of a racket hitting the ball while playing tennis, and the TV also provides synonymous acoustic feedback. i could see a digital instrument having a ‘rumble pack’ or whatever to vibrate using the output sound as its waveform but...i’m not sure how realistic this is or if it would even do what i want it to do but it’s Something To Think About</li><li>hhere are some albums worth checking out, also, for the curious (not at all comprehensive as these lists never are, just some things i have listened to recently that have informed/nourished/affected me in some way)</li><ul><li>daphne oram - “the oram tapes volume one”: this album is a scrapbook of some of oram’s experimentations and excerpts from compositions (i think there are some full ones here too) and it’s Rich n Exciting. several of these pieces are p dark and strange, incorporating feedback loops and tape delays etc., very cool and historically significant imo, daphne was THE pioneer of these techniques used near decades later w/o attribution. however, i can’t find any good streams for material from this album but there was a compilation from 2007 or so called ‘oramics’ which might actually be a more ‘complete’ feeling work anyway, though i have not listened to it in full. you can listen to the whole thing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcotoCd9qpQ">here (youtube link, full album)</a>.</li><li>laurie spiegel - <a href="https://unseenworlds.bandcamp.com/album/the-expanding-universe">“the expanding universe” (bandcamp stream)</a>: this album came out in 1980 but spiegel was doing work like this for something like...nearly 5-10 years prior, much of it at bell labs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">here is a link to the wikipedia article on bell labs</a>, which is a really Legendary place, but in brief, bell labs is a scientific research company found by the telephone company bell where a lot of technological advancements were conceived/developed (including the C++ programming lanugage and radio astronomy among many other (often nobel prize winning) things!! wow nice!!!). laurie spiegel developed software and programming languages to write algorithmically generated compositions, sometimes w/ accompanying procedurally generated visuals. like, in 1975, before windows 1.0. the compositions on this album feel almost ‘pastoral’ at points, which is neat considering these are ~entirely synth-based, mostly tape-softened square waves (i’m p sure), but some have more of a ‘cosmic’ focus...idk, i love this album a lot, lots of repetition but the motion is suggested underneath the musical phrases themselves through modulation of certain expressions, sort of like phillip glass maybe in a way, but that might be Reaching. i don’t get bored at all listening to these even though compositions sometimes reach 30 minutes in length b/c laurie spiegel knows how to Just keep your attention w/ musical variance without compromising the ‘meditative’ syrupy pace</li><li>“new music for electronic and recorded media - women in electronic music” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owsWbv94W3o&amp;list=PLUSRfoOcUe4Y2RSwMD6LwglSGU1WxuQvL">(youtube link, full album)</a>: this is a compilation album from 1977. not comprehensive, but the 8 pieces on this are all Incredible and playful and strange. if you’re wanting a tour of nonmen in early electronic music, the Pioneers, pls give this a listen <br></li><li>“the art of listening volume 1″ (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXv6Twzr5aM">youtube preview link</a>): another compilation. unfortunately, i just found out it was only released in japan so you might be hard-pressed to find it anywhere but on what.cd. if you want, though, feel free 2 reach out to me and i can probably help you out! but this is a selection of 10 or 15 ‘contemporary’ electronic compositions. included on this compilation are pieces by oneohtrix point never, arca, laurel halo, and others. a good tour of some interesting musical ideas of Today.</li><li>bjork - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHz1j1RVm6M">vespertine (youtube link, full album)</a>: i’m Way Way Late to get into bjork. i only listened to this album this year. like, a month ago. but Wow. every time i listen i am Floored at how it sounds, bjork’s string arrangements are so powerful and delicate (i cried listening to history of touches from vulnicura in the empty waiting room of a therapist’s office like three weeks ago) and it still feels so New, almost entirely untethered from time for me, hard to place it in a context, feels like it has always existed. bjork is also a very underrated producer, so thoughtful and emotive and meticulous and artful in how sounds are ‘positioned’ and ‘expressed.’ this is a quote abt how she approached the production/composition of this album with digital compression and piracy and computer speakers in mind: <br><br>"I use micro-beats, a lot of whispery vocals, which I think sound amazing when they're downloaded because of the secrecy of the medium. The only acoustic instruments I would use would be those that sound good after they've been downloaded, so the harp, the music box, celeste and clavichord. They're plucky sounds. [...] And the strings [...] ended up being more panoramic textures in the background. It’s all about being in a little house, on your own. [...] The strings would be like white mountains outside."<br><br>god god god i can’t get over it. i stan for bjork tbh.</li><li>honorable mentions (these are all just youtube links to individual songs): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S0xlbYcis0">coieda by takaga masakatsu</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmlJveN9IkI">r plus seven by oneohtrix point never</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWAghDS6s4Q">venice by fennesz</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-ZltnhvEf8">solo by tujiko noriko</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARcRMhag4jE">the city by vangelis</a> (this song is funny to me b/c i’m p sure brian eno ripped off or at least ‘took influence’ from this song when composing the startup sound for windows 95) but there are many others!!!<br></li></ul><li>final note: i am not especially well read in the history of electronic music yet, these are just Preliminary Findings and intuitive judgments, not at all definitive, so let me know if something in here is dubious or weird to you so i can learn more!! also recommend me articles or albums or anything you think i might find interesting based on this!! also there are probably typographical errors/omissions that i will search for later but i have worked on this for several hours and i want to be done with it</li></ul>

<p><ul><li>vascillating between being very very bored by sound and getting So Pumped abt it lately, trying to dissect and construct new approaches to sound n realizing how lazy most musicians/composers have been lately since the advent of computer music (myself included, i am very very guilty of everything i’m abt to talk about, may even address shortcomings of my to-be-released work in this post)</li><li>seems conspicuous/odd that the vast majority of ‘compositional/musical energy’ over last ~10 yrs has been expended not just on digging heels into the slick muddy ground of extreeeeeemely conventional tonality (locked into major/minor scales, w/o even exploring other modes w/in major-y/minor-y things) but also on attempting to replicate or mimic existing instruments or ‘instrumental orientations’ (by ‘instrumental orientations’ i mean pretty much all pop music over the last 10 yrs, regardless of how Digital it is, has been ‘skeumorphic’ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">link to definition</a>, this is an academic term (ewwwwww) for which there is no shorthand equivalent but i think it is a cool term to know it b/c it exactly describes a very specific phenomenon, which is one of the only things academia can be good at) of existing understandings of ‘pop’ instrumentation (really understandings that go back 100s of yrs). that is, even though we have the greatest degree of control over creating new sounds and the greatest degree of choice in how to orient them in a composition ever, the vast majority of digital sounds and techniques have been primarily concerned with things like creating virtual rhythm instruments which obey the same percussive rules/structures that pop songs in the 1930s did (snare kick crash hihat etc) even if they are more fucked up sounding, or creating lead synths which can compositionally mimic the lead guitar even if the timbre etc. feel very different, and so on....</li><li>why is this conspicuous/odd? sound is just is data conducted thru a medium (most relevantly, air) over time. for most of human history the acoustic data we could relay/manipulate was limited to what our bodies could do to compress air (constricting our vocal cords, tapping our bellies, etc.) or ‘acoustic devices’ with a preset, limited, specified function (instruments like guitars, pianos, violins....ok, n.b., there are ways even w/in existing acoustic devices to explore/manipulate new sounds (like slapping the top of a piano or scratching the strings of a violin with a nail file)) but there are pretty great limits to manipulation of acoustic devices in terms of 'sonic potential’...like a piano will never sound like a violin, just a consequence of its Form being more or less immutable, etc....</li><li>but now, the vast majority of our engagement w/ music is done through a Digital Intermediary......every sound you hear through your headphones is just data hitting you really, really, really quickly (typically around 44,100 times per second) being smoothed out by the continuous, ‘analog’ movement of a speaker driver. i’m still vERY MUCH in the process of learning how the digital representation of sound (as a file) gets converted into something that moves air but i will try to explain the best i can (even if just as an exercise to get me to learn it better)<br><br></li></ul><figure data-orig-width="982" data-orig-height="462"><img data-img-key="413" data-orig-width="982" data-orig-height="462" data-uploading-key="413" src="src" alt="image"></figure><ul><li>(source) this is a general diagram of the cycle of acoustic data to digital data to acoustic data again!! this looks sort of complicated but it’s actually really simple</li><li>i am getting so bored !!!!!!!!it can be any data....like it's literally just data vibrating a lil thing in a headphone or earplug, u could put anything thru a headphone.......so why are we (myself included) still writing songs in a major scale using digital instruments, or so focused on replicating existing modes of putting data thru the air (by trying to make instrumetns sound like existing instruments or at least mimic tonal qualities of existing paradigms of music (that have been around for 100s of yrs))seems wastefuli was thinking abt noise music todayand how it sucks mostlythere's some good noisebut it doesnt have a sense of relief n (get ready for an assumption n sweeping generalization) i feel like the intention of a lot of noise isnt to relay some feeling that couldnt be expressed otherwise, like i imagine a lot of it is just 'provocative' for provocations sake...'sense of relief' was an intuitive explanation for why i dont like it....i see it as stravinsky vs shoenberg for some reasonstravinsky challenged a lot of existing understandings of what sound should be (iirc) and it was provocative n probably intended to at least in p art be provocative but it also expressed something that couldnt have otherwise been expressed w/o this new vocabulary, but there are moments in stravinsky's work after the more avant garde What The Ffuck Was That moments that provide relief, that are sentimental and not as challenging, but then he fucks w/ those too (using melodies from russian folk songs, looping n cutting them, stravinsky maybe invented the #choppedandscrewed remix lol)but schoenberg doesnt have that same sentimentality and relief, is more 'heady' than stravinsky to me (like w/r/t my processing of their respective pieces), like i find schoenberg stimulating and interesting but he doesnt make me cry....do u kno what i meanwhats fucked up is that animal collective is probably contemporary indie stravinsky as far as pushing envelope of sound w/o abandoning some 'grounding' structures (thinking earlier (n some later) material which used 'noise' techniques, radically unpleasant textures, while not eschewing 'song structures' w/ some familiar 'harmonic techniques' etc...)i take it back abt schoenberg i bet his work could make me crybut some of his 12 tone piano pieces are likeboring to me in the same way that some noise is boring to mei explained to someone who hates jeff koons why i like jeff koons' work and they understood itsome of fennesz's noise work comes close to affecting me emotionally in a real waybut it falls short b/c i feel where he relies on very very conventional harmonic devicesunderneathand im likethese textures are nice but what u are doing underneath is boring and i cant take itnoisier** worklike on veniceim not trying to be shitty or 'intellectual' abt art that is employing 'conventional' techniques, this is very emotional for me n not heady at all in how it affects me....im not like 'bobbing my head' to something conventional n then shake my head b/c im frustrated/ashamed that i have engaged w/ clicheit's that when i listen to music i barely listen anymoreb/c i keep hearing the same ideasbeen listening to kate bush the last weekhounds of love u knoand there are like 5 parts that do things that catch my attentionmaybe 7i could listen and write down each individuallythere's a part where she is singing but there's a tremolo on her voice so u can't make out her words at all, sounds like light from a passing car cast thru window blindsand i was like haha that's so good and smart and funnyand the screams at the end of the big skywailsgodso goodbut the whole thing is not enough to stimulate me anymore.........feel like w/ sound its in some ways much harder to dodge/eschew structures than most other forms, b/c sounds which are 'asemic' (i.e. not intelligible under conventional paradigms of interpreting sound which we have come to internalize as Listeners, like the rules of tonality, the rules of rhythm) tend so quickly toward 'the unpleasant'.....whereas rothko seems beautiful b/c colors are beautiful......ugly color combos can be beautiful w/ a quick shuffling of heady expectation.....experimental films can eschew narrative and senses of space and representation and just flash lights at yo uand still be stimulating even tho there's no more 'conventional info' contained in the visual data......tho experimental films get grating the way noise gets grating.....wonder if it has to do more w/ time than medium....or like 'mode' not mediumlike time as a necessary and Controlled axis of experience....having to sit down with something and engage with it the way it wants you to....hmm...............hm.m.........oooo i was so on just thinking abt schoenberg vs stravinsky i am so pleased<a href="https://youtu.be/olwVvbWd-tg?t=216">https://youtu.be/olwVvbWd-tg?t=216</a>i didnt know they were actualy two different schools b/c i am all self-taught abt music u knofeel so pleasedlove the feeling of intuiting something and finding scholars who have said what u already saidlol"&lt;a
